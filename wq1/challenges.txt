Reverse a string, 
1. in place
2. by using a stack
---
Write a function that accepts a string of parentheses, and outputs True if they are correctly nested. For example: 
checkNesting( “(()())” ) → true
Now write a function that accepts both () and {}. A sequence like {({})} is valid. You must decide if { ( } ) is valid also.
---
Write a function that accepts 2 parameters, size and density, between 0 and 1, which generates a random graph. For example: genGraph(0.60, 0.35) might generate a graph around 60% of the maximum possible size (max decided by you), with 35% of possible edges existing.

Now implement BFS on that graph, or Dijkstra’s if you chose to have weighted edges.
